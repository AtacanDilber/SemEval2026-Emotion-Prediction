## Dataset

The SemEval-2026 Task 2 dataset files are provided by the task organizers and are not included in this repository.

The notebook expects the organizer-provided CSV files to be located
at the paths used during development.

To run the notebook **without modifying the code**, place the dataset
files in the same directory structure as originally used.

Required files:
- train_subtask1.csv
- train_subtask2a.csv
- train_subtask2b_detailed.csv
- trial_data.csv

If you prefer a different directory structure, you may update the file
paths inside the notebook accordingly.
